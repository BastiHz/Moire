- more patterns, see english wikipedia
- key controls: wasd, qe, move 10 pixels, rotate one degree
- smooth rotation. Need pixel alphas for that. But avoid edge artifacts.
- show name, angle and offset (of the centers) in top left corner
- more arguments: foreground color, background color
- pattern-specific command line arguments: line width and distance, circle radius and distance, etc.

Try a different technique for smooth edges with colorkey and with less edge artifacts:
Keep foreground and background always at size with double sidelength. Also have a big surface for combining the two. In the draw method first blit background and foreground onto the big surface, then smoothscale that down with dest=target_surface (the window). Make sure to adjust the foreground_rect for proper rotation. Also remember to draw patterns at double the size.
This shouldn't hurt performance because drawing is only done when something changes and it doesn't use pixel alpha transparency.
